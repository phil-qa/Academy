    "# What is Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Jupyter short tutorial. If you can see this then the system has started up correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "The original intent of a Jupyter notebook is as a tool for interactively developing and presenting data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our context though, the 'notebooks' are being used as live training documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## what is a “notebook”?\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook integrates python code, text and code outputs into a single document that could combine visualizations, narrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or, in other words, it's a single document where you can run code, display the output, and also add explanations, formulas, charts, and make your work more transparent, understandable, repeatable, and shareable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### our notebooks\n",
    "For the purposes of this course, our notebooks are listed in the academy programming folder. For someone who is entering into the world of coding, the Python.Primer notebooks cover the basics that are also expressed in the course slides. There are also challenge notebooks and cheat sheet notebooks for reference, feel free to explore them \n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook interface\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is essentially an advanced word processor. This content that you are reading now is stored in a cell. A cell is an area in the notebook that contains either code or text, where the text is expressed in markdown. It's not the intent of this course to teach you notebook operations in depth, there is a host of online resources for that. For now though note that cells contain content and they can be 'run' to execute that content, if it's text then running the cell will clode it for modification to the text and disply the contents in a formatted way and is self contained in the cell you ran, the result of running a cell that has code is an output which appears after the cell when it is run. Lets try that. Below is a cell that currently has one command in it but it is commented out (wont actually do anything), delete the # and click the run button above. Watch what happens"
